    "mission": "My mission is to democratize access to technology that solves real problems. From healthcare AI that helps patients navigate complex medical information to safety systems that prevent workplace injuries, I focus on building solutions that create measurable positive impact in people's lives.",
    "philosophy": "I believe technology should be a bridge, not a barrier. Every line of code I write is guided by the question: 'How will this make someone's day better, safer, or more productive?' This human-centered approach has led me to work across continents, cultures, and domainsâ€”always seeking to understand the real challenges before building the solutions.",
